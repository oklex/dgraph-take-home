This was a take-home assignment from Nathan.

## Working Assumptions made:
- Only concerned about the desktop view
- 

## Questions I have for the team/designer:
- Which headings are header 1,2,3 or paragraph? This might affect SEO.
- The second link is broken - what should it be replaced by?
- Without having designs for the mobile or tablet views, it's hard to scale the location of the text boxes, of particular concern is the white text on the homepage, which will cause problems if overlapping the white arrow lines of the image. How should the screens scale for different aspect ratios?How should the screens scale for different aspect ratios?

## If I had more time:
- Use SCSS instead of just css, for organized and better structured stylesheets
- Better organized styles
- Created re-useable components for the text-box and button (I didn't because I didn't want to waste time on it and the styling would need to be done differently using tailwind if it's goal was to actually be re-used)
- read more about gastby and tailwind
- reviewed more about gatsby repo organization
- try to figure out how much of the styling could be made universal, and which need to be page specific
- maybe add some nice transistions or animations
- make the favicon nice
